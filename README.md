# üß† LLM File Describe

**LLM File Describe** is a **QGIS plugin** that uses a **locally hosted large language model (via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai))** to analyse and describe geospatial data files.  
It supports both **vector formats** (such as `.shp` and `.gpkg`) and **raster formats** (such as `.tif` and `.img`).  
The plugin reads metadata and sample data from the file and asks the language model to infer what the dataset represents (e.g., cities, roads, land use) and summarise its contents.

## üöÄ Features

- **Vector file support:**  
  Loads `.shp` or `.gpkg` files, extracts field names, counts features and samples up to 10 rows from the attribute table to provide context.

- **Raster file support:**  
  Loads raster formats (`.tif`, `.tiff`, `.img`), reports image dimensions, pixel size, bounding box coordinates, and basic statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and pixel count) for each band.

- **Language selection:**  
  Choose the language of the model‚Äôs response (**English or French**) from a drop-down list.

- **Follow-up questions:**  
  After the initial description, you can ask questions about the dataset and the model will answer based on the previous context.

- **Information dialog:**  
  An info button (`?`) explains the purpose and usage of the plugin directly in QGIS.

## üß© Requirements

- **QGIS 3.0+** ‚Äî Tested with QGIS 3.40 LTR, but should work with any modern version.  
- **Ollama** ‚Äî Must be installed and running locally, with at least one LLM model (e.g. `llama3.1`).  
  The plugin sends HTTP requests to the Ollama API at:  
  `http://localhost:11434/api/chat`
